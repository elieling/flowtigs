# Flowtigs

An algorithm for computing [flowtigs](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.17.567499v1) from DNA reads of a metagenome.

The steps to compute flowtigs from reads are the following:

1.  [Install Rust](#1-installation-of-rust)
2.  [Run ggcat or bcalm on the reads](#2-running-ggcat)
3.  [Run flowtigs on the output of ggcat or bcalm](#3-running-flowtigs)

## 1. Installation of Rust

First, install [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) if not yet installed.

### Installing Rust on Linux or macOS

Run the following code snippet in your terminal window

```
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

### Installing Rust on Windows

Follow this [link](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and follow the instructions to install rustup.

## 2. Running ggcat

[ggcat](https://github.com/algbio/ggcat) takes reads as input and outputs a file that can be used by flowtigs, see [example](https://github.com/elieling/flowtigs-data) of the input and output format of ggcat. Download ggcat with the following commands
```
git clone https://github.com/algbio/ggcat --recursive
cd ggcat/
git checkout a91ecc97f286b737b37195c0a86f0e11ad6bfc3b
cargo update time
cargo install --path crates/cmdline/ --locked --features "kmer-counters"
```

Then, ggcat is run with

```
ggcat build -k <k> -j <threads> -e -s <minimum multiplicity> '<input file name>' -o '<output file name>'
```
where 
- `<k>` represents the desired k-value, which is the same that will be used by flowtigs
- `<threads>` represents the number of threads on which ggcat will run
- `<minimum multiplicity>` minimum multiplicity needed for a k-mer to occur
- `<input file>` represents the path to the input file which contains the reads
- `<output file>` represents the path to the desired output file, which will be the input file for flowtigs

## 3. Running flowtigs

The input of flowtigs should be a file in the same format as the output of [bcalm](https://github.com/GATB/bcalm) or [ggcat](https://github.com/algbio/ggcat). An example can be seen [here](https://github.com/elieling/flowtigs-data/tree/main/output_of_ggcat).

Clone this project with the following commands
```
git clone https://github.com/elieling/flowtigs.git
cd flowtigs
cargo build --release
```
Then, run flowtigs with the folowing code in the project directory
```
flowtigs --input "<input file>" -k <k> -t <threshold> --output "<output file>"
```
where 
- `<input file>` represents the path to the input file
- `<k>` represents the desired k-value
- `<threshold>` represents the desired threshold for filtering. To run flowtigs without filtering, use threshold 0
- `<output file>` represents the path to the desired output file


### Output

The output of flowtigs is a FASTA file, which contains the safe maximal string sequences named by an index from 0 to `<total number of sequences> - 1`. See example [here](https://github.com/elieling/flowtigs-data/tree/main/output_of_flowtigs).
